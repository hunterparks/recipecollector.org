prepTime: 20
totalTime: 60
yield: "2 loaves"
ingredients:
  - "2 cups - Warm Water, 110 °F/45 °C"
  - "½ cup - White Sugar"
  - "1 ½ tablespoons - Active Dry Yeast"
  - "1 ½ teaspoons - Salt"
  - "¼ cup - Vegetable Oil"
  - "5-6 cups - Flour, all-purpose or bread flour"
directions:
  - "In a large bowl, dissolve one tablespoon of the sugar in warm water
  and then stir in yeast. Allow to proof until yeast resembles a creamy
  foam, about five minutes."
  - "Mix remaining sugar, salt, and oil into the yeast. Mix in flour one
  cup at a time. Dough should be tacky and clean the sides of the bowl
  save for a small part at the bottom. Too much flour added in yields a
  dry loaf of bread, so if you're worried you added too much, add a bit
  more hot water, until you get the correct consistency."
  - "Knead dough for seven minutes. Place in a well-oiled bowl and turn
  dough to coat. Cover with a damp cloth. Allow to rise until doubled in
  bulk, about one hour."
  - "Punch dough down. Knead for one minute and divide in half. Shape
  into loaves and place into two greased 9x5 inch loaf pans. Allow to rise
  for 30 minutes, or until the dough has risen one inch above pans."
  - "Bake at 350 °F (175 °C) for 30-40 minutes. Cool, brush with butter
  and enjoy!"
