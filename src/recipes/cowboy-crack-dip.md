directions:

  with a wooden spoon or on low speed until
  everything is well combined."

  or chives."

notes:
  - "TIPS AND VARIATIONS"
  - "If you are serving this dip to a large
  crowd, you may want to double the recipe."
  - " Add up to 2 cans of Mexi-corn or
  sweet corn to the dip."
  - "For a spicier dip, add a can of diced jalapeÃ±os."
  - "For a smokier flavor, use smoked cheddar cheese."
  - "Add in some chopped green onions for a
  little bit of color and extra flavor."
  - "Try serving this dip with pretzels
  instead of chips or crackers."
  - "If you want a really cheesy dip, use
  two types of cheese. One type can be a
  strong-flavored cheese, such as cheddar,
  while the other can be milder cheese, such as Swiss."
  - "For a healthier version of this dip,
  substitute low-fat or fat-free sour cream,
  and cream cheese. You can also use turkey
  bacon to reduce the fat content."
  - "Add in some chopped fresh herbs, such
  as dill, parsley or chives, for a pop
  of color and flavor."
  - "If you want a creamier dip, add in
  an extra Â¼ cup of sour cream or milk or
  half and half for a thinner dip."
  - "HOMEMADE RANCH MIX"
  - "Â¼ cup buttermilk powder"
  - "2 teaspoons garlic powder"
  - "1 teaspoon onion powder"
  - "1 teaspoon dried parsley"
  - "1 teaspoon dried dill weed"
  - "1 teaspoon dried chives"
  - "Â½ teaspoon dried tarragon"
  - "Â½ teaspoon sea salt"
  - "Â¼ teaspoon ground black pepper"
  - "In a small bowl mix all the
  ingredients, and keep in an airtight
  container. Use as needed, replacing
  ranch dip mix."
  - "STORAGE TIPS"
  - "Refrigerator | It would be a miracle
  if you have leftovers! Store in an
  airtight container up to 2-3 days, best
  eaten within first 24 hours."
  - "Freeze | If you happen to have leftover
  dip, freeze up to 3 months in an airtight
  container. And since it will change the
  texture slightly, I suggest allowing to thaw
  overnight in the fridge, then transferring
  to a baking dish, cover with foil and bake
  at 400 degrees F for about 15-20 minutes,
  until hot and bubbly."
  - "WARM CRACK DIP"
  - "If you want to make this dip into a
  hot dip, then simply make the dip, spread
  into a 2 quart casserole dish and cover
  with foil. Bake at 400 degrees for about
  15-20 minutes until hot and bubbly. Top
  with fresh green onions and a little
  shredded cheddar. Serve with pita chips or
  tortilla chips and watch people go crazy!"
