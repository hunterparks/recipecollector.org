prepTime: 10
totalTime: 40
yield: "6 servings"
ingredients:
  - "4 tablespoons - Salted Butter"
  - "2 cups - Leftover Ham, diced"
  - "1 cup - Onion, diced"
  - "3-4 tablespoons - Flour"
  - "2 cups - Chicken Stock"
  - "2 cups - Milk"
  - "4 cups - Potatoes, peeled and diced"
  - "1 cup - Sharp Cheddar Cheese, shredded & extra for topping"
  - "¬Ω cup - Greek Yogurt"
  - "Kosher Salt, to taste"
  - "Black Pepper, to taste"
  - "Green Onions, chopped for garnish (optional)"
directions:
  - "Melt 2 Tablespoons of butter in a dutch
  oven over medium-high heat."
  - "Add ham to the pot and saute until golden
  brown stirring frequently, about 5 minutes.
  Remove from the pan."
  - "Add the remaining 2 Tablespoons butter and melt."
  - "Add onions and saute stirring periodically
  to soften, about 3-4 minutes."
  - "Sprinkle flour onto the onions and stir to fully coat."
  - "Add chicken stock, milk and potatoes and bring
  to a boil then reduce to medium low heat and
  simmer for 15 minutes. It will thicken a bit
  during this time."
  - "Add greek yogurt and cheese and use an
  immersion blender to puree the soup until
  it's partially blended (so there are still some
  chunks of potato but its also thicker)."
  - "Add 1 ¬Ω cups of diced ham into the soup."
  - "Taste for seasoning and add salt and pepper to taste."
  - "Serve topped with remaining diced ham, extra
  cheese and chopped green onions."
notes:
  - "Flour can vary. I gave a range for the
  amount of flour to use depending on how thick you
  want it. If you find that it's thinner than you
  had hoped, you can always mix a little flour with
  a little water and mix it in as it simmers to
  make it thicker."
  - "Skip bagged shreds. Shredding the cheese
  yourself allows it to melt easier than pre-shredded
  (but both work!)."
  - "Don't have an immersion blender? No problem! Pour
  half the soup into a blender or food processor,
  puree and add back into the pot."
  - "Salted butter is best! I like to use salted
  butter because it adds even more great flavor."
  - "Storage and Leftovers: This makes tasty leftovers
  and will last for up to 4 days covered in the
  refrigerator. But be aware that it gets a lot
  thicker when it cools. This is easily remedied by
  adding a little milk or water when you reheat it."
  - "Adjust seasonings as needed. Be sure to taste
  and adjust the seasonings if needed."
  - "Ingredients to prep ahead: Chop the ham, chop
  the onion, shred the cheese."
