  - "Â¼ cup - Non-Fat Drype Milk Powder"
  - "1 tablespoon - Granulated Sugar"
  - "2 Â¼ teaspoons - Instant Rapid-Rise Yeast"
  - "Â½ teaspoon - Salt"
  - "1 â…“ cups - Warm Water"
  - "2 tablespoons - Olive Oil"
  - "4 cups - Bread Flour"
  - "DIPPING SAUCE"
  - "15-ounce can - Tomato Sauce"
  - "1 teaspoon - Granulated Sugar"
  - "1 teaspoon - Dried Oregano"
  - "Â½ teaspoon - Dried Basil"
  - "Â½ teaspoon - Dried Marjoram"
  - "Â½ teaspoon - Garlic Powder"
  - "Â¼ teaspoon - Salt"
  - "BREAD STICK SEASONING"
  - "2 tablespoons - Grated Parmesan Cheese"
  - "1 tablespoon - Onion Powder"
  - "1 tablespoon - Dried Oregano"
  - "1 Â¾ teaspoons - Garlic Powder"
  - "1 Â½ teaspoons - Dried Basil"
  - "Â½ teaspoon - Salt"
  - "12 tablespoons - Unsalted Butter, divided, melted"
directions:
  - "Make the Dough: Place the dry milk powder, sugar, yeast and
  salt in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook.
  Add the water and stir to mix well. Allow to sit until the mixture
  starts to bubble, about two to five minutes. Add the olive oil
  and stir again."
  - "On low speed, gradually add the flour until a dough begins to
  form. Increase the speed to medium-low and knead until a soft,
  slightly tacky dough forms and it clears the sides of the bowl,
  about five minutes. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface
  and divide in two."
  - "Coat the bottoms of two 9x13-inch pans with four tablespoons each
  of the melted butter. Roll each piece of dough into a 9x13-inch rectangle
  and fit in the bottom of each pan. Brush the tops of the dough with 1
  tablespoon melted butter each. Wrap tightly in plastic wrap and place in a
  warm, draft-free area until puffed and nearly doubled in size, about 90 minutes."
  - "Make the Dipping Sauce: While the dough is rising, prepare the dipping
  sauce. In a small saucepan, stir together the tomato sauce, sugar, oregano,
  basil, marjoram, garlic powder and salt. Place over medium heat until the sauce
  begins to boil, then reduce to low and simmer for 30 minutes, stirring
  occasionally. Remove from heat."
  - "Bake the Breadsticks: Preheat the oven to 475 Â°F."
  - "Once the dough has risen, remove the plastic wrap and score each pan of
  dough into ten equal breadsticks (I used a pizza cutter). Bake until golden
  brown and the edges begin to look crisp, 10 to 15 minutes."
  - "For the Breadstick Seasoning: While the breadsticks are in the oven, prepare
  the breadstick seasoning. In a small bowl, stir together the Parmesan cheese,
  onion powder, oregano, garlic powder, basil and salt."
  - "As soon as the breadsticks come out of the oven, brush each pan with the remaining
  one tablespoon each melted butter, then immediately sprinkle with the breadstick
  seasoning. Allow to cool for 5 to 10 minutes in the pan, then use a spatula to slide
  the breadsticks out onto a cutting board. Slice the breadsticks with a pizza cutter
  or knife and serve warm or at room temperature with the dipping sauce."
notes:
  - "You can also mix and knead the dough by hand - just knead until smooth, slightly tacky ball forms."
