prepTime: 15
totalTime: 30
yield: "8 servings"
ingredients:
  - "2 pounds - Red-skinned Potatoes, or New Potatoes"
  - "1 teaspoon - Salt, plus more to taste"
  - "10 ounces - Green Beans, fresh, about 2 cups cut into 1-inch pieces"
  - "1/2 cup - Onion, sweet or red, chopped"
  - "1/2 cup - Celery, thinly sliced"
  - "3/4 cup - Mayonnaise, more to taste"
  - "2 tablespoons - Dill relish, or to taste"
  - "2 tablespoons - Lemon Juice"
  - "2 tablespoons - Sour Cream"
  - "2 tablespoons - Dill, fresh, chopped"
  - "Black Pepper, freshly ground, to taste"
directions:
  - "Scrub the potatoes and cut them into 1-inch pieces.
  Put the potatoes in a large saucepan and cover with
  water. Add 1 teaspoon of salt. Bring to a boil; reduce
  heat to medium-low, cover, and cook for 12 to 15
  minutes, or until potatoes are fork-tender. Drain and
  let cool completely."
  - "Rinse the green beans; cut off and discard the stem
  ends. Put washed and trimmed green beans in a steaming
  basket. Put the basket in a pan with about 1 to 2 inches
  of water. Bring to a boil over medium heat, cover,
  and cook for about 5 to 7 minutes, or until they are
  tender-crisp as desired. If you're using frozen green
  beans, follow the package directions to steam or microwave."
  - "Transfer the cooled potatoes to a large bowl along
  with the cooled steamed green beans, chopped onion,
  and sliced celery. Toss lightly to blend."
  - "In another bowl, combine the 3/4 cup of mayonnaise,
  relish, lemon juice, the sour cream, and fresh dill.
  Add salt and pepper, as needed to taste."
  - "Gently combine the potato mixture with the dressing.
  If necessary, add a little more mayonnaise. Taste and
  adjust the seasonings."
notes:
  - "Red-skinned potatoes add color when left unpeeled,
  but go ahead and peel them if that's your preference.
  Some other low to moderate starch potatoes: new
  potatoes, round white, Kennebec, and Yukon Gold."
  - "The Instant Pot is a great choice for cooking the
  potatoes, especially if you're trying to keep the
  kitchen cool. Plus, there's less mess with no boil-over.
  Place the trivet in the Instant Pot, add the cut-up
  potatoes, and set it for 3 minutes at high pressure.
  Release the steam immediately. Drain the potatoes and
  let them cool."
