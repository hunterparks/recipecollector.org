prepTime: 15
totalTime: 50
yield: "1 round"
ingredients:
  - "CRUST"
  - "2 cups - Riced Cauliflower, about ¬Ω head"
  - "1 clove - Garlic"
  - "1 cup - Part-Skim Mozzarella Cheese, shredded"
  - "1 - Egg, beaten"
  - "1 teaspoon - Dried Basil"
  - "1 teaspoon - Dried Oregano"
  - "1 teaspoon - Olive Oil, for greasing (or spray)"
  - "TOPPINGS"
  - "‚Öì cup - Pizza Sauce"
  - "1 cup - Part-Skim Mozzarella Cheese, shredded"
  - "Fresh Basil"
  - "Crushed Red Pepper Flakes"
directions:
  - "Preheat oven to 400 ¬∞F."
  - "Line a baking sheet or pizza stone with parchment. Grease the
  parchment with olive oil spray or rub on regular olive oil."
  - "If using whole cauliflower, remove the stems and leaves from
  the cauliflower and chop the florets into chunks. Add to a food
  processor or blender and pulse just until the texture is similar
  to rice. If you don‚Äôt have a food processor or high powered blender,
  you can grate the cauliflower with a cheese grater or chop it.
  Another (much faster option) is to buy riced cauliflower."
  - "Saut√© cauliflower ‚Äúrice‚Äù in a non-stick skillet over medium heat
  and cook until translucent, approximately 6-8 minutes. (You can use
  the microwave for this as well. Just place cauliflower in an uncovered
  microwave-safe bowl and cook for 8 minutes.)"
  - "In a bowl combine the cooked cauliflower with garlic, mozzarella
  cheese, egg, basil and oregano. The cheese will melt a bit and this
  is okay."
  - "Spread dough out evenly on your parchment lined baking sheet and
  form into a circle. You‚Äôll want it to be about 1/4 to 1/3 of an inch
  thick. The pizza should be about 9-10 inches in diameter."
  - "Bake for 25-30 minutes or until the crust is golden, crispy on
  the edges and cooked through the middle."
  - "Remove the crust from the oven and set oven to broil."
  - "Top with pizza sauce and cheese. You can also add additional
  toppings, but be careful not to add too many heavy toppings as you
  don‚Äôt want to weigh down the crust."
  - "Broil the pizza for 5 minutes, or until the toppings are hot and
  the cheese is melted. Allow the pizza to cool for 2-3 minutes then
  cut and serve immediately. Serve with fresh basil and crushed red pepper."
