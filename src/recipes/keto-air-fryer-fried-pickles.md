prepTime: 15
totalTime: 25
yield: "2 servings"
ingredients:
  - "2 cups - Dill Pickle Slices"
  - "1 tablespoon - Coconut Flour"
  - "1 - Egg, large"
  - "1 cup - Pork Panko (ground-up pork rinds)"
  - "Â½ teaspoon - Garlic Powder"
  - "Â½ teaspoon - Paprika"
  - "Â¼ teaspoon - Ground Black Pepper"
  - "Sea Salt, to taste (see notes)"
  - "Optional: Avocado Oil, to spray or brush_"
  - "Optional: Ranch Dressing, for dipping_"
directions:
  - "Preheat the air fryer to 400 degrees F."
  - "Pat dry the pickle slices with a kitchen or paper towel
  and place in a large bowl."
  - "Sprinkle the pickles with coconut flour and toss gently
  so all sides are coated."
  - "In a separate bowl, crack and whisk the egg."
  - "In another bowl, mix together pork panko, garlic powder,
  paprika, salt, and pepper."
  - "Working in batches, dredge the pickle slices in the egg
  wash."
  - "Shake off the excess and press into the pork panko mixture.
  Transfer to a plate and repeat with the rest of the pickle slices."
  - "Arrange the dill pickle slices in a single layer in the air
  fryer. You may need to work in batches depending on the size
  of your air fryer."
  - "For extra crispy pickles, spray or brush the pickles with
  avocado oil."
  - "Air fry for 10 minutes, flipping then spraying (or brunshing)
  with avocado oil again halfway through."
  - "Serve immediately with ranch dressing, or your favorite dip!"
notes:
  - "The pickles that I used were plenty salty on their own so I
  didnâ€™t add any more salt. I would taste the pickles first before
  to determine if you want to add more salt or not."
