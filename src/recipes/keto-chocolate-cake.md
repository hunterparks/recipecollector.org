  - "‚Öî cup (100g) - Confectioners Swerve"
  - "¬æ teaspoon - Baking Soda"
  - "¬æ teaspoon - Baking Powder"
  - "Pinch of Salt"
  - "3 - Eggs, room temperature"
  - "2 ¬Ω tablespoons (35g) - Coconut Oil, melted"
  - "¬º cup, heaping (75mL) - Unsweetened Vanilla Almond Milk"
  - "1 teaspoon - Vanilla Extract"
  - "BUTTERCREAM FROSTING (OPTIONAL)"
  - "2 sticks - Butter, room temperature"
  - "1 cup, just less than (125g) - Confectioners Swerve"
  - "1 cup (80g) - Unsweetened Cocoa Powder"
  - "¬Ω cup (120mL) - Vanilla Unsweetened Almond Milk"
directions:
  - "Preheat your oven to 350 Degrees."
  - "Takeout the eggs and butter, and start bringing them up to
  room temperature."
  - "Now, start adding all of the dry ingredients for the keto
  chocolate cake to a large bowl. Note: I highly recommend weighing
  the ingredients out to the gram on a food scale for best results!"
  - "Mix and combine the dry ingredients, and then add the wet ingredients."
  - "Fold the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients until a thick
  cake batter forms."
  - "Once it does, coat a 7\" springform pan with baking spray and add
  the cake batter to the pan."
  - "Once you've added the batter, spread it out evenly in the pan,
  and then bake it in the oven for 20-25 minutes."
  - "The cake will be done when the edges of the cake just start to
  pull away from the pan itself."
  - "Now, when the cake is done baking let it cool down in the pan
  itself."
  - "Once it's cool, remover the outer ring of the springform pan, and
  then transfer the cake to a plate/cake stand flipping it upside down
  in the process."
  - "Now, add the frosting, and use a frosting spatula to evenly distribute
  it around the keto cake."
  - "Once the frosting is applied, the cake is done!"
  - "FROSTING (OPTIONAL)"
  - "While the cake is baking, make the frosting...if you're making
  the frosting."
  - "So, in a large bowl add the butter and then cream it with a
  hand mixer."
  - "Once the butter is creamed, add all of the other ingredients into
  the bowl, and then fold them into one another until a thick frosting forms."
notes:
  - "Macros don't account for the Confectioners Swerve, it has zero calories and
  0 net carbs. The macros also do not include the Keto Chocolate Buttercream
  Frosting as it is optional. Remember to subtract the fiber from the carbs
  to get net carbs per slice...."
  - "3.5g Carbs - 2g Fiber = 1.5g NET CARBS"
