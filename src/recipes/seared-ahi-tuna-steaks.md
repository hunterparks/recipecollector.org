prepTime: 5
totalTime: 5
yield: "2 servings"
ingredients:
  - "2 ahi tuna (yellowfin tuna) steaks (about 4 oz. each, 1\" thick - see notes for thinner or thicker)"
  - "2 tablespoons [soy sauce](https://amzn.to/2LquzA6)"
  - "1 tablespoon [toasted sesame oil](https://amzn.to/2vyMwBD) see notes"
  - "1 tablespoon [honey](https://amzn.to/2WUcpr1) see notes"
  - "1/2 teaspoon [kosher salt](https://www.bowlofdelicious.com/salt/)"
  - "1/4 teaspoon [black pepper](https://amzn.to/2Ix82hA) to taste"
  - "1/4 teaspoon [cayenne pepper](https://amzn.to/2IoHDCS) (optional)"
  - "1 tablespoon [canola oil](https://amzn.to/2GoVaYr) or olive oil"
  - "green onions, toasted sesame seeds, and lime wedges for serving (optional)"
directions:
  - "Pat the ahi tuna steaks dry with a paper towel. Place on a plate or inside a plastic bag."
  - "Mix the soy sauce _(2 tablespoons)_, toasted sesame oil _(1 tablespoon)_, honey _(1 tablespoon)_
  kosher salt _(1/2 teaspoon- OMIT if marinating for more than a couple hours, see notes)_, pepper
  _(1/4 teaspoon)_, and cayenne pepper _(1/4 teaspoon)_ until honey is fully dissolved. Pour over
  the ahi tuna steaks and turn over to coat completely. **Optional**: allow to marinate for at least
  10 minutes, or up to overnight in the refrigerator. **Also optional**: Reserve a spoonful or two
  of the marinade before coating the fish for drizzling on top after you've cooked it."
  - "Heat a medium skillet _(preferably non-stick or a well-seasoned cast iron skillet)_ on medium-high
  to high until very hot _(or medium medium-high for nonstick)_. I recommend giving cast iron 3-5 minutes
  to get hot and nonstick about 1 minute, depending on how thick it is."
  - "Add the canola oil _(1 tablespoon)_ to the hot pan. Sear the tuna for 1 - 1½ minutes on each side
  for medium rare _(2 -2½ minutes for medium-well to well, 30 seconds for very rare. See notes - this will
  vary based on thickness of the tuna steaks)_. _(Note: different burners get hotter depending on your
  stove. Use your best judgement whether you use medium, medium-high, or high heat, as the marinade may
  burn if too high heat is used)_"
  - "Remove to a cutting board. Slice into 1/2 inch slices and serve garnished with green onions, toasted
  sesame seeds, and a squeeze of fresh lime juice, if desired."
notes:
  - "**For thinner or thicker tuna steaks**, you may need less or more searing time. If you are using
  tuna steaks that are less than 1 inch, I recommend no more than 1 minute per side, depending on your
  preference for doneness. For thicker steaks, you may need to do 2 minutes per side. You may also need
  less searing time depending on the temperature of your fish- if it's been sitting out of the fridge for
  a while, it will take less time to cook."
