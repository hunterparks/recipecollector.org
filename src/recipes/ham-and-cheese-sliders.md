prepTime: 5
totalTime: 35
yield: "12 sliders"
ingredients:
  - "1 package - Hawaiian Sweet Rolls, 12-count, sliced in half"
  - "¾ pound - Cooked Deli Ham, thinly sliced"
  - "¾ pound - Swiss Cheese, thinly sliced"
  - "½ cup - Unsalted Butter, melted"
  - "1 tablespoon - Dijon Mustard"
  - "1 tablespoon - Poppy Seeds"
  - "2 teaspoons - Dried Minced Onions"
  - "2 teaspoons - Worcesteshire Sauce"
  - "¼ teaspoon - Salt, or to taste"
  - "¼ teaspoon - Pepper, or to taste"
directions:
  - "Preheat oven to 350 °F. Line a 9×9-inch or 9×13-inch pan with
  aluminum foil, spray with cooking spray; set aside."
  - "Using a large serrated knife, slice the rolls in half so you
  have a ‘slab’ of tops and a ‘slab’ of bottoms; don’t pull the
  rolls apart and slice individually because you want to keep them connected."
  - "Place the bottom ‘slab’ of rolls in prepared pan."
  - "Evenly layer about half of the ham over the rolls."
  - "Evenly layer the cheese."
  - "Evenly layer the remaining ham."
  - "Add the top ‘slab’ of rolls; set aside."
  - "To a medium microwave-safe bowl, add the butter and heat on high
  power to melt, about 1 minute."
  - "Add the mustard, poppy seeds, onion, Worcestershire sauce, salt,
  pepper, and whisk to combine."
  - "Evenly and slowly pour the butter mixture over the rolls. Use a
  spatula to spread the mixture over the tops. Some of the mixture will
  pool at the base of the rolls."
  - "Cover with aluminum foil and allow rolls to stand at room temp for
  about 5 to 10 minutes."
  - "Bake covered for about 20 minutes or until cheese has melted."
  - "Uncover and cook for about 3 to 5 minutes, or until as done as desired.
  Baking time will vary based on the size of pan used, climate and oven
  variances, etc. Bake until as done as desired; watch to make sure they
  don’t burn since all ovens and ingredients vary."
  - "Slice into individual sliders and serve immediately. Sliders are best
  warm and fresh."
