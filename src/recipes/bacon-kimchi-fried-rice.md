totalTime: 35
yield: "12 servings (debatable)"
ingredients:
  - "1 1/2 cups fermented sour cabbage kimchi chopped"
  - "1/2 onion chopped"
  - "4-6 bacon strips chopped"
  - "2-3 tbsp kimchi juice"
  - "3 cups cooked rice"
  - "2 tsp Korean chili paste (gochujang)"
  - "2 tsp sesame oil"
  - "2 tsp toasted sesame seeds"
  - "salt and pepper to taste"
  - "1 cup roasted seaweed crumbled"
  - "4 eggs fried to sunny side up (or however many plates you end up making)"
directions:
  - "In a heavy skillet, cook bacon pieces until crisp. Transfer the bacon to a platter, and set aside."
  - "Using a paper towel, wipe off the bacon grease remained in the skillet but leave 1 tablespoonful."
  - "Saute onion in the reserved bacon grease until soft and tender over medium heat."
  - "Add the kimchi and continue to saute until kimchi is soft, about 5 minutes over medium-low heat,
  then add Korean chili paste and kimchi juice to the skillet and mix well to incorporate with kimchi and onion."
  - "Add the rice to the mixture and toss well. Try to separate the rice grains by using the vertical
  edge of spatula so that you don't smash the rice much."
  - "Add sesame oil and sesame seeds, and toss well. Season with salt and pepper as you wish."
  - "Raise the heat to medium heat and let the fried rice to sear for 2-3 minutes. This will help the
  rice on the bottom of skillet to be crisp. Adjust the heat, if needed, so that you don't burn it too
  much. Check the bottom of the fried rice to see it created desired crispness on the rice."
  - "Remove the skillet from the heat and sprinkle with the reserved bacon pieces and crumbled roasted
  seaweed. To serve, add sunny side up fried eggs on top. Enjoy while hot!"
