yield: "X servings"
ingredients:
  - "3 tablespoons white miso"
  - "5 teaspoons honey, divided"
  - "1 tablespoon soy sauce"
  - "2 teaspoons mirin"
  - "1 1/2 teaspoons toasted sesame oil"
  - "1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper"
  - "4 6-ounce center-cut salmon fillets (each 1 to 1¼ inches thick), patted dry"
  - "1 tablespoon sesame seeds, toasted"
  - "1 scallion, thinly sliced on the diagonal"
directions:
  - "In a small bowl, whisk together the miso, 4 teaspoons of honey, the soy
  sauce, mirin, sesame oil and cayenne. Measure out 2 tablespoons and brush
  onto the top and sides of the salmon fillets. Let stand at room temperature for 20 minutes."
  - "Meanwhile, into the remaining miso mixture, whisk the remaining 1 teaspoon
  honey and 2 tablespoons water; set aside. Heat the broiler with a rack about
  6 inches from the broiler element. Mist a wire rack with cooking spray, then
  set in a rimmed baking sheet."
  - "Evenly space the fillets, skin down, on the rack. Broil until the thickest
  part of the fillets reaches 110°F to 115°F, or are nearly opaque when cut into, 6 to 8 minutes."
  - "Transfer to a serving platter and drizzle with about 2 tablespoons of the miso
  mixture, then sprinkle with sesame seeds and scallion. Serve with the remaining miso mixture."
