        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol><li>Melt 2 Tablespoons of butter in a dutch oven over medium-high heat.</li><li>Add ham to the pot and saute until golden brown stirring frequently, about 5 minutes. Remove from the pan.</li><li>Add the remaining 2 Tablespoons butter and melt.</li><li>Add onions and saute stirring periodically to soften, about 3-4 minutes.</li><li>Sprinkle flour onto the onions and stir to fully coat.</li><li>Add chicken stock, milk and potatoes and bring to a boil then reduce to medium low heat and simmer for 15 minutes. It will thicken a bit during this time.</li><li>Add greek yogurt and cheese and use an immersion blender to puree the soup until it&#39;s partially blended (so there are still some chunks of potato but its also thicker).</li><li>Add 1 ¬Ω cups of diced ham into the soup.</li><li>Taste for seasoning and add salt and pepper to taste.</li><li>Serve topped with remaining diced ham, extra cheese and chopped green onions.</li></ol>

            <h3>Notes</h3>
            <ul><li>Flour can vary. I gave a range for the amount of flour to use depending on how thick you want it. If you find that it&#39;s thinner than you had hoped, you can always mix a little flour with a little water and mix it in as it simmers to make it thicker.</li><li>Skip bagged shreds. Shredding the cheese yourself allows it to melt easier than pre-shredded (but both work!).</li><li>Don&#39;t have an immersion blender? No problem! Pour half the soup into a blender or food processor, puree and add back into the pot.</li><li>Salted butter is best! I like to use salted butter because it adds even more great flavor.</li><li>Storage and Leftovers: This makes tasty leftovers and will last for up to 4 days covered in the refrigerator. But be aware that it gets a lot thicker when it cools. This is easily remedied by adding a little milk or water when you reheat it.</li><li>Adjust seasonings as needed. Be sure to taste and adjust the seasonings if needed.</li><li>Ingredients to prep ahead: Chop the ham, chop the onion, shred the cheese.</li></ul>
